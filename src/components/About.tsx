          <p>
            I'm a software engineer currently pursuing my Master's in Computer
            Science at George Mason University. I am experienced in developing
            modern web apps using React + TypeScript on the frontend and Python
            + FastAPI on the backend. I build efficient, scalable apps. I'm
            always eager to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge.
