          <p>
            I'm a software engineer currently pursuing my Master's in Computer
            Science at George Mason University. With work experience at Eigennet
            and Freddie Mac as well as a few cool side projects, I specialize in
            frontend development, cloud infrastructure, and have experience with
            backend development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I build efficient, scalable apps. I'm always eager to take on new
            challenges, expand my knowledge, and become a stronger developer.
